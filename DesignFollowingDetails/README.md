## üì± Quick Start

1. **Open in Xcode**: Double-click the `.swift` files or create a new iOS project and replace the default files
2. **Set Deployment Target**: iOS 15.0+ (recommended)
3. **Choose Device**: iPhone simulator or physical device
4. **Build & Run**: Press ‚åò+R or click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button

## ‚öôÔ∏è Xcode Configuration

### Modern Info.plist Setup (Recommended)

1. Select your **project** in Xcode navigator
2. Select your **app target**
3. Go to **Build Settings** tab
4. Search for **"Generate Info.plist File"**
5. Set it to **YES** (this is usually the default)

### Bundle Identifier
Set your bundle identifier in **Build Settings ‚Üí Product Bundle Identifier**:
- Example: `com.yourname.designfollowingdetails`


## üìç Location Permissions Required

Add these keys to your Info.plist in Xcode:

**For location access while app is in use:**
- **Key:** `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- **Value:** "This app needs location access to [describe your specific use case]"

**For background location access (if needed):**
- **Key:** `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`
- **Value:** "This app needs location access to [describe your specific use case]"


## üîî Notifications Setup

For local/push notifications, no Info.plist entries are required, but you may need to:

1. Enable Push Notifications capability in your app target
2. Request notification permissions in your code (already included)



## üîß Adding Info.plist Keys in Xcode

When you need to add the permission keys above:

1. Select your **project** in Xcode
2. Select your **app target** 
3. Go to the **Info** tab
4. Click the **+** button to add new keys
5. Add the keys and values listed above

**Alternative method:**
1. Right-click your project ‚Üí **Add Files**
2. Create new **Property List** file named `Info.plist`
3. Add the required keys and values

## üéØ App Features Detected

Based on your generated code, your app includes:
- **EventSyncProApp.swift**: Main app entry point

## üö® Troubleshooting

**Build Error: "Multiple commands produce Info.plist"**

- **Solution**: Either delete the custom Info.plist file OR set "Generate Info.plist File" to NO

**Permission Errors at Runtime**
- Make sure you've added the required permission keys to Info.plist
- The app will crash if you try to access restricted features without proper permission descriptions

## üìö Next Steps

3. **Test on Device**: Test on a physical iPhone for the best experience
